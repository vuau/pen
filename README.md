## Features
- Offline-First  
*Pen can work offline. Your data will be synced accross browsers/devices when you are online. Pen is also a PWA so you can install it on your phone or computer.*
- Encrypted  
*Your data is stored with a bank-level 256-bit AES end-to-end encryption by default, which means nobody but you can read your data.*
